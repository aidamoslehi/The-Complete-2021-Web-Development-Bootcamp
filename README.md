### Project 2(TinDog)  
* Using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootsrap5 created TinDog - I used bootstrap 5 because these changes were made in the "navbar".
-margin-left(ml) change to ms.
-margin-right(mr) change to me.
-padding-left(pl) change to ps.
-padding-right(pr) change to pe.
Also, these changes were made in the "container".
In addition, all attributes "data" in "carousel"  changed to data-bs-.
Moreover, we used .card-deck for cads in bootstrap 4 but it's removed in bootstrap5.
